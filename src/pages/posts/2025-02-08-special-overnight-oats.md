A _simple_ but **very** good overnight oats recipe which is my go to breakfast.
I make a batch of these (between 4 and 5) each in their little jar container
which is very convenient for mixing and storing.

## Ingredients

- 50g oats (adjust to taste depending on how thicc you like your oats)
- 10g peanut butter
- 10g maple syrup (skip if your protein powder is sweetened)
- 10g chia seeds
- 10g vanilla protein powder
- 200ml milk

## Instructions

1. in a container (a jam jar should be good) mix the maple syrup, the peanut
   butter and 10ml of the milk. The goal is to make the peanut butter less
   thick. The result should be relatively smooth.
2. add in the protein powder, the oats and the chia seeds. I like to do it in
   this order to make step 3 less awkward.
3. Pour the remaining 190ml of milk. if the container overfills wait for a few
   seconds for the air trapped inside to make its way out.
4. close the container, shake vigorously for a few seconds and store in the
   fridge.

I make these in the weekend for the following week. Its keeps pretty well, just
make sure that your milk is not too close to its expiry date.",A simple but VERY
good overnight oats recipe. I like to make a batch of 4-5 directly in their
container. I found that a jam container is perfect.
